# 🧵 End-to-End RMG Data Analytics (Power BI Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a complete **Business Intelligence (BI) solution** for the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry. It analyzes the entire production lifecycle—from **Yarn to Shipment**—identifying bottlenecks in knitting, sewing, and logistics.

The goal is to help management reduce fabric wastage, improve machine efficiency, and ensure on-time shipments using data-driven insights.

## 💡 Key Insights & Findings

### 🧵 Textile Section (TMS):
- **✅ Knitting Efficiency:** Strong performance at **78.5%**.
- **⚠️ Critical Issue:** **Dyeing Reprocess Rate is 12.3%**, leading to chemical wastage.
- **📉 Top Defects:** "Crease Marks" and "Needle Lines" are the major quality concerns impacting fabric yield.

### 👕 Garments Section (GMS):
- **⚠️ Major Risk:** Only **36% of shipments are On-Time**. Immediate planning improvement needed.
- **🏆 Top Buyer:** **"Global Basics Ltd"** (Consistent & Profitable).
- **🚚 Logistics:** High dependency on **"Truck to Port" (33%)**, indicating unplanned and costly shipments.
